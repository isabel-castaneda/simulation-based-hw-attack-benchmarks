# Simulation-Based Hardware Attack Dataset

This repository contains the source code for the programs used to generate a simulation-based dataset aimed at detecting hardware-level attacks using AI techniques.

These programs were compiled and simulated using the gem5 framework under the RISC-V architecture. The dataset includes:

- Benign programs
- Mlicious programs

This work is part of the Master’s Thesis titled:

> **Simulation-Based Evaluation of AI Techniques for Hardware Attack Detection**  
> High-Performance Computing specialization, MIRI Master's Program

## Structure

- `/benign/`: Simple programs with non-malicious behavior
- `/malicious/`: Programs that simulate or approximate hardware attacks
- `README.md`: this file
